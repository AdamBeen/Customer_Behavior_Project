## 🚀 How to Run

### ▶️ SQL
Run the SQL file in PostgreSQL:

psql -U postgres -d customer_behavior -f customer_behavior_SQL.sql
▶️ Python Notebook
Open and execute the Jupyter notebook:

Copy code
jupyter notebook customer_behavior_project.ipynb
▶️ Power BI
Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop to explore the interactive dashboard.

💡 Key Insights
Female customers contribute slightly more to total revenue.

Loyal customers generate a significant share of total sales.

Subscribed customers have higher average purchase amounts.

Discounted products drive short-term sales but reduce profit margin.

Express shipping correlates with higher-value purchases.
